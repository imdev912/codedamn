In this lab, you have to build a simple card layout using HTML and CSS flexbox. You need to create a container with class 'container' that encloses three div elements with class 'card'. Then, you have to style the container element with CSS flexbox to display its child elements in a row. You should also add a gap of 20px between each card. Finally, style the cards by giving them the same width and height, and a background color.
