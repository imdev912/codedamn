In this lab, you will build a simple password strength indicator by utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will create an input field for the user to enter a password, and ensure that your solution updates the user regarding its strength. The strength of a password will be determined using a set of rules you've learned about, such as length, character types, or other factors. Finally, you will use CSS to provide a visual representation of the password strength.

The purpose of this lab is to help you understand the nuances of password security, improve your skills in event handling as well as DOM manipulation, and teach you how to provide meaningful user feedback in real-time.
