In this lab, you have to create an interface for user to leave comments. You will write code for a form in the index.html file that includes a textarea with id 'comment', and a button with id 'submit'. This form must not refresh the page when submitted. Instead, the comments should appear underneath the form in a list format. Also include a paragraph with id 'error' to display error messages.
