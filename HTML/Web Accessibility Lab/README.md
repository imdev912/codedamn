In this hands-on lab, you will create an accessible webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective is to get familiar with best practices in web accessibility and make a webpage compatible with various assistive technologies. The lab will cover different aspects of web accessibility, such as semantic HTML, proper focus management, tab navigation, and accessible forms.

Throughout the lab, be ready to modify your index.html, main.css, and script.js files to solve the challenges. Please make sure to keep your code clean, well-structured, and well-documented. Think about the users who may have difficulty interacting with your website due to disabilities like visual impairments, hearing loss, cognitive disabilities or motor difficulties.
