In this lab, we will learn how to place two div elements side by side using the float CSS property. Float property defines how an element should float. It is often used for placing elements side by side especially when dealing with layouts.

First, we will create a div container that holds two child divs with the ids leftBox and rightBox. They should be initially arranged one below the other, just like any other block elements.

Then, by using the float CSS property, we will re-arrange these child divs so that they sit side by side. We will also give each child div unique background colors and a 10px margin between them. Finally, we will set both child divs' width and height to 100px each.
