Welcome to HTML Basic Semantic Layout Lab.

In this lab, you'll create a very simple html page layout that would contain four semantic html elements.

You would have to create a simple header , nav, main and footer elements with proper unordered list of links in the nav element using a tag.

Follow the challenges page to start writing the html markup. This lab has pre-written css, if you start writing the correct markup, you should see a simle background color for each different semantic element.
