In this lab, you have to create an aside tag with a class named 'sidebar' that contains an 'h3' tag with the text 'Interesting Facts' and an unordered list (ul) with three list items (li), each containing an interesting fact. The aside tag is used to mark up content that is related to the main content but is separate and can be considered as a secondary content. It is often used for sidebars, pull quotes, or image captions. The 'sidebar' class can be used to style the aside element with CSS later.
