In this lab, you will create a form with multiple fieldsets, each containing input fields and their respective labels. You will style these fieldsets and input elements along with legends using external CSS.

You must create an HTML file named index.html, having a form containing three fieldsets. Each fieldset should have at least three different user input fields (input, textarea, or select) with labels. The first fieldset should have a legend Personal Information, the second should have the legend Education Details, and the third one should have the legend Work Experience. You must also create a CSS file styles.css and link it inside the index.html. Add the following styles:

Fieldsets should have a background color of lightgray (#f1f1f1).
Legends should have a blue font color (#3E7AFF) and a font-size of 18px.
Add a padding of 10px to the input, textarea, and select elements.
Make sure that the form is properly formatted and easy to understand for the users.
